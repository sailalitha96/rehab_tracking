This folder consists of intergrating code between Kinect sensor and motor commands to arduino. 

This can be found in the path_control_motor commands

1.Function point_to_point will be used for the quadrant seperation of the robot and accordingly motor coordinates will be sent.

2. Path_control is the main file which is used for the sending the motor commands to arduino and communicating with the Kinect sensor.

3. Serial Comunication Motor uses the code for arduino to matlab communication. 

4. The image observed from the kinect sensor is 90 degrees roated to bring it to reference frame we use this function.
